# Copy IPTC Artwork Information into Keywords & Title

## Adobe Lightroom Plug-In

This is a simple plug-in that copies the IPTC artwork information from a photo into that photo's keywords & title fields.
I wrote this plug-in to enable me to search by IPTC artwork fields because they are not exposed to the normal
methods by which Lightroom can search for photos.

## Getting Started

Adobe Lightroom plug-ins are written in a subset of the [Lua](https://www.lua.org/) language.
